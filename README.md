# Pairs-Memory-Game
This project is a desktop application with a rich user interface built using C# and a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) framework. The memory tiles matching game is a fun and engaging way for users to test their memory and concentration skills. Featuring a range of customization options, including the ability to select a preferred picture for your avatar and a custom board, this game incorporates game statistics for each player to see its performance compared to those of other players.

The player's objective is to flip over tiles and match pairs of identical images before time runs out. The game is designed to be intuitive and easy to play. The player must complete 3 consecutive tile matchings to get the highest level and win the game.
